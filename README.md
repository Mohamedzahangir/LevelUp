# LevelUp ⬆️⚡

**LevelUp** is a gamified fitness web application focused on **discipline, consistency, and long-term progress**.  
It transforms daily fitness actions into a clear progression system using **levels, XP, streaks**, and a unique **“Hidden Potential” cinematic loading experience**.

This project prioritizes **intentional UX**, **psychological motivation**, and **clean frontend architecture** over feature overload.

---

## ✨ Core Philosophy

> **Progress over perfection.**  
> Small daily actions, compounded over time, create real change.

LevelUp is designed to:
- Motivate without guilt
- Avoid unrealistic promises
- Reward consistency, not intensity
- Feel calm, premium, and focused

## 🎥 Signature Feature — Hidden Potential Loading Screen

Every time the app is opened, users experience a short cinematic loading animation that visualizes **potential being unlocked**.

### Key characteristics:
- Uses the user’s own photo (opt-in)
- Shows a **continuous transformation** through lighting and clarity
- **No body reshaping or fake predictions**
- White light reveal + blue progress ring
- Single figure only (no comparisons)

The animation adapts:
- **Full cinematic version** for milestones
- **Short compressed version** for daily opens  
Both always show visible progress and muscle definition forming.

This feature establishes identity and motivation before the dashboard appears.

## 🏠 Dashboard (Home Screen)

The dashboard is intentionally minimal and answers three questions instantly:

1. **Who am I right now?**  
   → Level  
2. **Am I progressing?**  
   → XP progress  
3. **What should I do next?**  
   → One primary action

### Dashboard elements:
- **Level** (primary identity)
- **Circular XP progress ring**
- **Streak indicator**
- **One main action button**
- Secondary quick actions (water, nutrition, logs)

No charts.  
No clutter.  
No scrolling on first load.
